- Work out examples of tensor product decomposition with numerical index values to
  see how it works. We do not seem to have a complete implementation yet, as the
  VEST identities should be derivable, but they do not work yet (the free index 
  stays free).

  It is of course in the end all a generalisation of symm + antisymm.

- make sure editing of a notebook cell goes into the right dtree node.

- cleanup_nests is not following the rule that nothing below the iterator
  is allowed to change. 

- core status: next: pass varying arguments to algorithms.

- gui status: document logic

- response (output) cells should have the ability to remove previous output, or this
  should already be done at execute. Link output to input by making them children?

- need to start using DataCell ids so we can attach output to the right input cell.
