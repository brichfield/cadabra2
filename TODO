- Work out examples of tensor product decomposition with numerical index values to
  see how it works. We do not seem to have a complete implementation yet, as the
  VEST identities should be derivable, but they do not work yet (the free index 
  stays free).

  It is of course in the end all a generalisation of symm + antisymm.

- make sure editing of a notebook cell goes into the right dtree node.

- Current status: we either make property declaration a function call, so that there is no 
  python object for C++ property objects. Or we keep objects on the python side, but then
  we need a custom constructor. That starts working for 'Indices' in the current version,
  but I have not yet figured out how to extract arguments (and in particular 'ex') in
  init_property<...> (in PythonCdb.hh).



- cleanup_nests is not following the rule that nothing below the iterator
  is allowed to change.
