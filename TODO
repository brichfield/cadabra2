- rename Client to Document ?

- split Client into Document and Client; the latter should then be solely
  responsible for talking over the net.

- Work out examples of tensor product decomposition with numerical index values to
  see how it works. We do not seem to have a complete implementation yet, as the
  VEST identities should be derivable, but they do not work yet (the free index 
  stays free).

  It is of course in the end all a generalisation of symm + antisymm.
