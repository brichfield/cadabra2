- Work out examples of tensor product decomposition with numerical index values to
  see how it works. We do not seem to have a complete implementation yet, as the
  VEST identities should be derivable, but they do not work yet (the free index 
  stays free).

  It is of course in the end all a generalisation of symm + antisymm.

- cleanup_nests is not following the rule that nothing below the iterator
  is allowed to change. 

- core status: next: pass varying arguments to algorithms.

- add kernel starting/restarting logic to ComputeThread

- gui status: document logic

- server: currently keeps python alive, restart?

- For ActionRemoveCell we need to flip the order of remove gui and execute on doc,   
  or not? Depends on whether we keep the cell floating alive outside the Doc or not.

- bug: when trying to run a cell without connected kernel, the second run produces
  a gtk warning.

- client_server: implement move_out, move_in, move_in_below in tree.hh using move 
  semantics and then continue with ActionRemoveCell.
