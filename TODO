- Work out examples of tensor product decomposition with numerical index values to
  see how it works. We do not seem to have a complete implementation yet, as the
  VEST identities should be derivable, but they do not work yet (the free index 
  stays free).

  It is of course in the end all a generalisation of symm + antisymm.

- cleanup_nests is not following the rule that nothing below the iterator
  is allowed to change. 

- core status: next: pass varying arguments to algorithms.

- gui status: document logic

- catch error on trying to send to non-connected server

- server: do pre-parsing.
- server: currently keeps python alive, restart?
- server: also keep track of input cell id.

- bug: declaring in one cell and printing in other produces one empty return.
