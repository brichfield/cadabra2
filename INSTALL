Cadabra building and installation instructions
----------------------------------------------


A. Linux
--------

Building from source requires a number of packages. On Debian and
derivatives they can all be installed with

  sudo apt-get install cmake python-dev g++ libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libgmp3-dev 
  sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0-dev libjsoncpp-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev

In order to actually be able to run the Cadabra notebook frontend, you then also need

  sudo apt-get install texlive python-matplotlib python-mpmath

but most likely you have a TeX installation already. 

In order to build the documentation you also need

  sudo apt-get install doxygen libjs-mathjax


Build and install using

   make
   sudo make install



B. OS X
--------

When building Cadabra from source on OS X, you need XCode (naturally)
as well as a number of libraries which are readily available from
Homebrew, http://brew.sh.  Before attempting to build Cadabra, make
sure a basic Homebrew installation is present, and then do

  brew install cmake boost boost-python pcre gmp jsoncpp python pkgconfig

Make sure that the Homebrew Python is first in your path (_not_ the 
system-provided python) by putting /usr/local/bin as the first path
in /etc/paths, so that the file /etc/paths looks something like

   /usr/local/bin
   /usr/bin
   /bin
   /usr/sbin
   /sbin

In order to run the Cadabra notebook interface succesfully, you also
need a TeX installation such as MacTeX, http://tug.org/mactex/ .
Any TeX will do, as long as 'latex' and 'dvipng' are available, and
the 'breqn' package is installed.

Then do the following to configure Cadabra:

   cd cadabra2
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..

This configures the system and will warn you about missing dependencies. 
Build and install using

   make
   sudo make install

You can then run the self-tests using

   make check

(these tests currently require that you have done 'sudo make install' 
first). The command line version is started with

   cadabra2

and the (not yet functional) GUI is started (from the build directory) with

   ../frontend/osx/Cadabra/build/Release/Cadabra.app/Contents/MacOS/Cadabra
