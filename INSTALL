Cadabra building and installation instructions
----------------------------------------------

The Cadabra source is distributed among several subdirectories, many of
which can be built independently:

   - core:          The main cadabra sources plus the logic to make it accessible
                    as a Python module 'cadabra'. These are all system-independent.

   - client_server: GUI-independent classes for building a cadabra server and client.
                     
   - frontend:      Implementations of the front-end for various platforms, as well
	                 as platform-independent support code for e.g. maths typesetting.


A. Linux
--------

Building from source requires a number of packages. On Debian and
derivatives they can all be installed with

  sudo apt-get install g++ libjsoncpp-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev

(you can get away with fewer parts of boost). In addition one needs
websocket++ from

  http://www.zaphoyd.com/websocketpp



B. OS X
--------

When building Cadabra from source on OS X, you need XCode (naturally)
as well as a number of libraries which are readily available from
Homebrew, http://brew.sh.  Before attempting to build Cadabra, make
sure a basic Homebrew installation is present, and then do

  brew install cmake boost boost-python pcre gmp jsoncpp python pkgconfig

In order to run the Cadabra notebook interface succesfully, you also
need a TeX installation such as MacTeX, http://tug.org/mactex/ .
Any TeX will do, as long as 'latex' and 'dvipng' are available, and
the 'breqn' package is installed.

Then do the following to configure Cadabra:

   cd cadabra2
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..

This configures the system and will warn you about missing dependencies. 
Build and install using

   make
   sudo make install

You can then run the self-tests using

   make check

(these tests currently require that you have done 'sudo make install' 
first). The command line version is started with

   cadabra2

and the (not yet functional) GUI is started (from the build directory) with

   ../frontend/osx/Cadabra/build/Release/Cadabra.app/Contents/MacOS/Cadabra
