Cadabra building and installation instructions
----------------------------------------------

The Cadabra source is distributed among several subdirectories, many of
which can be built independently:

   - core:          The main cadabra sources plus the logic to make it accessible
                    as a Python module 'cadabra'. These are all system-independent.

   - client_server: GUI-independent classes for building a cadabra server and client.
                     
   - frontend:      Implementations of the front-end for various platforms, as well
	                 as platform-independent support code for e.g. maths typesetting.


A. Linux
--------

Building from source requires a number of packages. On Debian and
derivatives they can all be installed with

  sudo apt-get install g++ libjsoncpp-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev

(you can get away with fewer parts of boost). In addition one needs
websocket++ from

  http://www.zaphoyd.com/websocketpp



B. OS X
--------

When building Cadabra from source on OS X, you need XCode (naturally)
as well as a number of libraries which are readily available from
Homebrew, http://brew.sh.  Before attempting to build Cadabra, make
sure a basic Homebrew installation is present, and then do

  brew install cmake boost pcre gmp jsonpp

HERE: shall we just include websocketpp into the tree?

In order to run the Cadabra notebook interface succesfully, you also
need a TeX installation such as MacTeX, http://tug.org/mactex/ .
Any TeX will do, as long as 'latex' and 'dvipng' are available, and
the 'breqn' package is installed.
