Cadabra building and installation instructions
----------------------------------------------

Moved to README.rst.



In order to build the documentation you also need

  sudo apt-get install doxygen libjs-mathjax



B. OS X
--------

The main thing to get right is to have a version of CMake which deals
properly with a Homebrew-installed python. Do 

  brew uninstall cmake
  brew install nikolausdemmel/homebrew-devel/cmake


Then do the following to configure Cadabra:

   cd cadabra2
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..

and the (not yet functional) GUI is started (from the build directory) with

   ../frontend/osx/Cadabra/build/Release/Cadabra.app/Contents/MacOS/Cadabra
