Cadabra installation instructions
---------------------------------

The Cadabra source is distributed among several subdirectories, many of
which can be built independently:

   - src:     the main cadabra sources plus the logic to make it accessible
              as a Python module 'cadabra'.

   - server:  

   - gui:


A. Linux
--------

Building from source requires a number of packages. On Debian and
derivatives they can all be installed with

  sudo apt-get install g++ libjsoncpp-dev 

In addition one needs websocket++ from

  http://www.zaphoyd.com/websocketpp



B. OS X
--------

When building Cadabra from source on OS X, you need XCode (naturally)
as well as a number of libraries which are readily available from
Homebrew, http://brew.sh.  Before attempting to build Cadabra, make
sure a basic Homebrew installation is present, and then do

  brew install cmake boost pcre gmp json-cpp

In order to run the Cadabra notebook interface succesfully, you also
need a TeX installation such as MacTeX, http://tug.org/mactex/ .
