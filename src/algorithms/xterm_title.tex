\cdbalgorithm{xterm\_title}{}

When the program is running in command-line mode, this command
set the title of the xterm to the given argument: 
\begin{screen}{1,2}
@xterm_title{"second part"};
\end{screen}
This can be useful to monitor the stages of a long calculation: by
putting this command at intermediate stages it becomes easier to spot
the current status of a running job.
