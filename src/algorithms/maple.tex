\cdbalgorithm{maple}{}

Feed an expression through the Maple computer algebra system. This
allows you to e.g.~do trigonometric simplification or other `scalar
computer algebra' for which \cdb does not have any built-in support.
\begin{screen}{1,2,4,5}
simplify( sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 ):
@maple(%);
1;
integrate( \sin(x)**2, x ):
@maple(%);
- 1/2 \sin(x) \cos(x) + 1/2 x;
\end{screen}
Note that reserved names, like the \verb|\sin| above, get converted to
Maple notation automatically (and they get translated again when
the result is read back into \cdb).

This command is preliminary and not yet fully functional.
