\cdbproperty{Symbol}{}

If you want to attach symbols to tensors in sub- or superscript, as
in~$A^\dagger$, you need to inform the system that this symbol is not
an index (otherwise it may interpret~$A^\dagger A^\dagger$ as two
contracted vectors with vector indices~$\dagger$). This is done by
associating the \subsprop{Symbol} property to the symbol; in this
example
\begin{screen}{1,2}
\dagger::Symbol.
A^\dagger A^\dagger;
\end{screen}
A related effect is induced by the \subsprop{Coordinate} property.
