cell_type:

  our "input"    their "code"
      "latex"          "?"

our "textbuf"   their "source"
our "hidden"    their "collapsed"

- they do not have "cell_id"; we should auto-generate cell-ids if not
  present.
- they may have a 'worksheets' wrapper
- they have "markdown" cells.
- we have input and output latex cells; we could have input markdown
  and output latex.
