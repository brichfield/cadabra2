\item Connect to server which already serves a notebook to someone
  else.

\item Files are stored locally. The client pushes the file to the
  server for computation. Do we push the entire file?

  which is present in the current scope).

\item Hierarchical rule browser, e.g. to turn Riemann into metric and
  that sort of thing.

be able to refer to them in other cells.
