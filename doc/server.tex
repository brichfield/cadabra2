Structure of client/server.


Gtkmm:
  - main loop with gtkmm
  - c++ thread cond_waiting for requests
  - gui action putting request in queue
  - thread sync-waiting
  - on result, thread subclass onFinish updates gui using
    gdk_thread_enter/leave.


Cocoa:
  - main loop with cocoa
  - c++ thread cond_waiting for requests
  - this thread is a subclass of something generic with onFinish callback
  - gui action putting request in queue and notifying thread
  - thread sync-waiting for network
  - on result, thread calls onFinish, which in this particular
    implementation sends the result data to the main thread using
    GCD.
