This repository holds the 2.x series of the Cadabra computer
algebra system. 

Cadabra was designed specifically for the solution of problems
encountered in field theory. It has extensive functionality for tensor
computer algebra, tensor polynomial simplification including
multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables, Clifford
algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate dependence,
multiple index types and many more. The input format is a subset of
TeX. Both a command-line and a graphical interface are available.

To get started with the source code documentation, navigate to the
\ref modules overview.
