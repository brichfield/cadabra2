\section{Storage conventions}

\subsection{Numerical factors}

All numerical multipliers in a product on the product node, no
multiplier on a sum node.

\subsection{Fractions}

Any \verb|\frac| nodes with a purely numerical denominator should be
rewritten as a rational multiplier for the numerator node. 

\subsection{Derivatives}

Derivative nodes can have an arbitrary number of index child nodes and
must have at least one function child node. The first function node is
interpreted as the argument on which the derivative(s) act. All other
nodes indicate with respect to which object or variable the
derivatives are taken.
