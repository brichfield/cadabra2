\section{Algorithms}

The implementation of \verb|apply(iterator&)| is not allowed to make
the node pointed at by the iterator invalid. If the algorithm makes
the node vanish, it should indicate so by setting its multiplier to
zero; the calling logic will then take care of cleaning up the subtree
at the node.

The algorithm is allowed to change the node itself or replace it with
another one, as long as it updates the iterator.
