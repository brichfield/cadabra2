\section{Algorithms}

The implementation of \verb|apply(iterator&)| is not allowed to make the node
pointed at by the iterator invalid. If the algorithm makes the node
vanish, it should indicate so by setting its multiplier to zero; the
calling logic will then take care of cleaning up the subtree at the
node.
