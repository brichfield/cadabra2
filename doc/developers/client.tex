\section{Client architecture}

All clients use two threads. One is the main thread and runs most of
the logic in the {\tt DocumentThread} object. The other one is a
thread which communicates with the server process; code for this
thread is in the {\tt ComputeThread} object.  One typically subclasses
the former into a full-fledged object driving the graphical user
interface.
