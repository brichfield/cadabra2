\subsection{Arguments}

Properties can have arguments. These are not parsed by Python, but
rather by the C++ side. There is a number of reasons for doing things
this way. The most important of them is that this makes it a lot
easier for Cadabra to provide useful feedback on parameters which are
not valid.

Parsing is done by implementing the virtual function
`\verb|parse(keyval_t&)|'. The argument is a container class which
represents the arguments passed to the property as key/value pairs
(the \verb|keyval_t| type is defined in \verb|Props.hh|).
