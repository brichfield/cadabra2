\section{Input format}

The input format of Cadabra~II follows the Python language
specification, with the following additional rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A line containing a \verb|:=| token is interpreted as a Cadabra
  expression declaration. If the line does not end with a semi-colon
  \verb|;| following lines are added until a line is found which does
  end with a semi-colon. The newlines between these lines are replaced
  with a single space character.

  [example]

  This is translated to the following expression before it is being
  handed to the Python interpreter.

  [translation]

\item A line containing a \verb|::| token is interpreted as a Cadabra
  property declaration. The same rule for line continuation is used.

\item Anything inbetween two dollar symbols is interpreted as a
  Cadabra expression (just like \TeX{} handles mathematical
  expressions).

\item A line ending with a semi-colon \verb|;| will lead to the output
  of the last-used expression being printed. To be precise, it will
  insert a \verb|print(latex(_))| into the input.
\end{enumerate}
The interactive shell \verb|cadabra2| will indicate Cadabra line
continuations by showing a `|' symbol as prompt (instead of the
`\verb|>|' shown for new lines.
