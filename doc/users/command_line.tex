\subsection{Options}

\begin{tabularx}{.8\textwidth}{lX}
\verb|-d| & Run in debug mode, in which a Cadabra crash will land you in gdb
            from which you can inspect stack traces and so on (only useful for
            developers).
\end{tabularx}



\subsection{Editing facilities}

When entering a Cadabra expression, that is, when a line contains a
\verb|:=| or \verb|::| token indicating an expression or property
declaration respectively, Cadabra enters a multi-line input mode which
is somewhat different from the Python editing mode. As long as the
input does not end on a colon \verb|:| or semi-colon \verb|;| new
lines will be requested, and this is indicated by the prompt becoming
a vertical bar. Multi-line input is strung together as one line before
being fed to the Cadabra parser.
