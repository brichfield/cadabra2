<h1>Developers</h1>
<p>
  If you want to help out with Cadabra, or think you can contribute a
  useful add-on package or perhaps even just a sample notebook, please
  get in touch at <a href="mailto:info@cadabra.science">info@cadabra.science</a>.
</p>

<h1>Source code documentation</h1>
<p>
  The source code is documented in quite some detail and the resulting
  <a href="doxygen/html">Cadabra doxygen documentation</a> is worth
  consulting if you want to become a developer. You can generate this
  yourself in your own working copy by running <code>doxygen</code> in
  the project root.
