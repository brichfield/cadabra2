<h1>Cadabra tutorials</h1>
<p>
  The tutorials listed below are produced from actual Cadabra
  notebooks. Instead of reading them on-line, you can also download
  the notebooks and play with them inside Cadabra.
</p>

<h2>Absolute beginners</h2>

<p>
  This notebook explains how to enter expressions, how to do simple
  substitutions on them, how to use wildcards. It also explains how the
  new Python functionality works.

  If you have used old versions of Cadabra but are new to series 2.x,
  this is a good place to start too.
