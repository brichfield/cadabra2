<h1>Cadabra tutorials</h1>
<p>
  The tutorials listed below are produced from actual Cadabra
  notebooks. Instead of reading them on-line, you can also download
  the notebooks and play with them inside Cadabra. These notebooks all
  require the new 2.x version of the software and will not work with
  the old version 1.x.
</p>

<h2>Absolute beginners</h2>

<p>
  This notebook explains how to enter expressions, how to do simple
  substitutions on them, how to use wildcards. It also explains how the
  new Python functionality works. If you have never used Cadabra
  before, start here.

  If you have used old versions of Cadabra but are new to series 2.x,
  give the following notebook a shot.

<h2>Sympy users</h2>
<p>
  Cadabra relies on Sympy for all scalar computer algebra, that is,
  for all algebra on expressions which do not involve indices. Here is
  a simple notebook to illustrate the basic concepts. This may also be
  a useful read if you want to use the Cadabra notebook interface just
  to work with Sympy.

<h2>Actions, equations of motion, variational derivatives</h2>
<p>

<h2>Groups and algebras</h2>
<p>
  Dirac gamma matrix algebra is very simple with Cadabra, and it can
  handle them in arbitrary dimensions.

<h2>Component computations</h2>
<p>
  From version 2.x you can do abstract as well as component
  computations with Cadabra. The logic is very simple and based on a
  few key ideas rooted in Cadabra's substitution engine. Examples of
  varying difficulty are available below.

<h2>Using Cadabra from IPython/Jupyter</h2>

<p>
  Because most Cadabra functionality is now accessible as a Python
  module, you can easily use Cadabra from IPython/Jupyter notebooks
  with a Python kernel. This notebook shows some of the absolute
  basics. Note that this is different from using IPython/Jupyter
  notebooks inside the Cadabra GUI.

<h2>Plotting</h2>

<p>
  Cadabra's notebook now displays graphics from a variety of Python
  sources; see the notebook below for some basic examples.
