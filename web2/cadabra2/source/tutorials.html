<h1>Cadabra tutorials</h1>
<p>
  The tutorials listed below are produced from actual Cadabra
  notebooks. Instead of reading them on-line, you can also download
  the notebooks and play with them inside Cadabra.
</p>

<h2>Absolute beginners</h2>

<p>
  This notebook explains how to enter expressions, how to do simple
  substitutions on them, how to use wildcards. It also explains how the
  new Python functionality works. 
</p>
<p>
  If you have used old versions of Cadabra but are new to series 2.x,
  this is a good place to start too.

<h2>Component computations</h2>


<h2>Using Cadabra from IPython/Jupyter</h2>

<p>
  Because most Cadabra functionality is now accessible as a Python
  module, you can easily use Cadabra from IPython/Jupyter notebooks
  with a Python kernel. This notebook shows some of the absolute
  basics.
