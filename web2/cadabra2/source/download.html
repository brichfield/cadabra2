<h1>Download and install</h1>
<p>
  Given the current state of Cadabra version 2, it is at present only
  distributed in source code form.
</p>
<div class="download_options">
  <a href="cadabra2-latest.tar.gz">cadabra2-latest.tar.gz</a>
</div>
<p>
  You will need to install a number of dependencies before you can
  compile it. On Ubuntu/Mint/Debian simply do
</p>
<pre>
  sudo apt-get install cmake python-dev g++ libpcre3 libpcre3-dev libgmp3-dev 
  sudo apt-get install libgtkmm-3.0-dev libjsoncpp-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev
  sudo apt-get install texlive python-matplotlib python-mpmath
  sudo apt-get install doxygen libjs-mathjax  
  sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev uuid-dev
</pre>
<p>
  You can get away with less (not all of boost is necessary, for
  instance), but the above should be sufficient to build everything,
  including the developers' documentation.
</p>
<p>
  A git repository will be available shortly.
