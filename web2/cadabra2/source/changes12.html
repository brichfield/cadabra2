<h1>New in version 2</h1>
<p>
  Many things changed/improved in version 2 with respect to version 1:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cadabra manipulations can now programmed using Python. The
  input format is a combination of Cadabra's old LaTeX-based
  format mixed with standard Python, so you still get all the
  benefits of LaTeX-style input.</li>

  <li>You can now do both abstract tensor computations as well as
  component computations. This means that you can manipulate tensorial
  expressions as you did before, and then plug in values for their
  components.</li>
  
  <li>The notebook interface now also has facilities for displaying
  plots and other graphical output. You can thus explore the results of
  component computations graphically.</li>

  <li>The user interface now takes into account text scaling settings
  on high-dpi screens, so it the font size in LaTeX output cells
  matches that of the input cells.</li>

  <li>Cadabra now relies solely on libraries which are rather common,
  and is easier to build as it now uses CMake instead of GNU autotools.
  </li>

</ul>

<h1>Algorithm name changes from version 1 to 2</h1>
<p>
  The main change with respect to algorithm names is that the '@'
  prefix for algorithms is no longer necessary. Algorithms are now
  standard Python functions. They take an expression as their first
  argument, and (optionally) further arguments to determine what to
  do. You can use an underscore to refer to the last entered
  expression, so you can write <code>collect_factors(_)</code> where
  you would previously write <code>@collect_factors(%)</code>.

  Where you would previously use an exclamation mark to act at any
  level, you now add the <code>deep=True</code> argument to a
  function. This is the default for many algorithms where that makes
  sense, so you often do not have to add it at all. 

  A number of algorithms (and a few properties) have changed name or
  behaviour while going from version 1 to version 2. This was done
  mostly to make naming more consistent and to avoid weird acronyms in
  algorithm names. 
</p>

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p>
  In general, all algorithms now have names of the form 'action' or
  'action_object'.
