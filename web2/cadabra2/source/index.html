<h1>Warning</h1>
<p>
  This is a pre-alpha version of the new Cadabra web site, describing
  the pre-alpha version of the new Cadabra software. If you actually
  want to get work done, you probably want to visit
  the <a href="http://cadabra.phi-sci.com">old site</a> for now.
</p>

<h1>What is Cadabra?</h1>
<p>
  Cadabra is a symbolic computer algebra system (CAS) designed
  specifically for the solution of problems encountered in field
  theory. It has extensive functionality for tensor computer
  algebra, tensor polynomial simplification including multi-term
  symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables, Clifford
  algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate
  dependence, multiple index types and many more. The input
  format is a subset of TeX. Both a command-line and a graphical
  interface are available.
  <ul>
	 <li>
		Designed for field-theory problems, with handling of
		anti-commuting and non-commuting objects without special notations
		for their products, gamma matrix algebra, Fierz identities, Dirac
		conjugation, vielbeine, flat and curved, covariant and
		contravariant indices, implicit dependence of tensors on
		coordinates, partial and covariant derivatives...
	 </li>
	 <li>
		Powerful tensor simplification algorithms, not just for
		mono-term symmetries but also for multi-terms symmetries like
		the Bianchi identity, or dimensionally-dependent symmetries like
		the Schouten identity.
	 </li>
	 <li>
		A standalone graphical notebook interface <a href="jupyter.html">compatible
		with IPython/Jupyter notebooks</a>.
	 </li>
	 <li>
		Input and output using a subset of LaTeX notation.
	 </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
  
</p>

<h1>Status of version 2</h1>
<p>
  Over the span of 2014 and 2015 a large part of Cadabra was
  rewritten from scratch, in order to accommodate many changes
  requested by users. Here is where we are at the moment:
  <ul>
	 <li>
		Cadabra manipulations can now programmed using Python. The
		input format is a combination of Cadabra's old TeX-based
		format mixed with standard Python. 
	 </li>
	 <li>
		About a third of all algorithms and properties have been
		ported. A lot of the automated tests work again.
	 </li>
	 <li>
		The component computation engine is almost complete.
	 </li>
  </ul>
