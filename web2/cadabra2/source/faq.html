  <dt>Why not build the tensor functionality into Sympy, and wedge
	 into Sympy's expression parser in <code>sympy.parsing.sympy_parser</code>?
  </dt>
  <dd>
	 Cadabra uses the philosophy that expressions should be represented
	 in their own language, not Python. However, one can do something
	 like that in Sympy, by only feeding expressions in string form to
	 the logic in <code>sympy.parsing.sympy_parser</code>. So in a
	 sense Sympy supports this Cadabraesque mode of working, even
	 though the tutorials and examples do not emphasise it.

	 The reason why Cadabra nevertheless uses its own parser, and its
	 own tree representation of expressions, is simply that an enormous
	 amount of work would have to be done to rewrite the lot so that it
	 fits into the Sympy framework. Moreover, little would be gained by
	 doing this: almost all functionality which is in Sympy and which
	 would make sense when applied to tensors (think of taking
	 derivatives, or pattern matching) would require a lot of extra
	 Sympy code to extend it beyond scalars.

	 The way things are now the separation is clean, localised, and
	 relatively easy to maintain. If you would ever rewrite
	 Cadabra+Sympy from scratch you might take a different approach,
	 but that's not going to happen soon.

  <dt>Why an independent notebook interface instead of building on
	 IPython?
  </dt>
  <dd>
	 <p>There are a number of reasons for this. For starters, Cadabra's
	 notebook interface predates IPython (that is, a publically
	 available version of it) by quite a few years. That by itself is
	 of course not a very good reason to keep developing the Cadabra
	 notebook interface, but it does play a certain role.</p>

	 <p>A more important reason has to do with the fact that there are,
	 despite what one might think at first inspection, quite a few
	 differences between IPython/Jupyter and the Cadabra interface. The
	 most obvious one is that Cadabra is a native application, which
	 does not rely on a web browser to display its results. I still
	 think that native applications have their place, as they tend to
	 look and feel much better than web apps.</p>

	 <p>IPython/Jupyter tend to be focussed a lot on data-centric
	 problems, and less so on being a nice front-end for symbolic
	 mathematics. These two do differ.</p>

	 <p>Another reason to keep developing the Cadabra notebook
	 interface is that it allows me much more flexibility in trying new
	 features and ideas. As a consequence, Cadabra for instance has a
	 way to open multiple views on the same notebook.
