  <dt>Why an independent notebook interface instead of building on
	 IPython?
  </dt>
  <dd>
	 <p>There are a number of reasons for this. For starters, Cadabra's
	 notebook interface predates IPython (that is, a publically
	 available version of it) by quite a few years. That by itself is
	 of course not a very good reason to keep developing the Cadabra
	 notebook interface, but it does play a certain role.</p>

	 <p>A more important reason has to do with the fact that there are,
	 despite what one might think at first inspection, quite a few
	 differences between IPython/Jupyter and the Cadabra interface. The
	 most obvious one is that Cadabra is a native application, which
	 does not rely on a web browser to display its results. I still
	 think that native applications have their place, as they tend to
	 look and feel much better than web apps.</p>

	 <p>IPython/Jupyter tend to be focussed a lot on data-centric
	 problems, and less so on being a nice front-end for symbolic
	 mathematics. These two do differ.</p>

	 <p>Another reason to keep developing the Cadabra notebook
	 interface is that it allows me much more flexibility in trying new
	 features and ideas. As a consequence, Cadabra for instance has a
	 way to open multiple views on the same notebook.
