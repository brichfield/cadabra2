<p>
  If you use Cadabra or even just play with it, I would like
  to hear about it. Please send me an email so that I can get an
  idea of who is interested in this program. And remember:</p>
<p class="quote">
  <a href="http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AxiomCommunity">The "rule of 3"</a>: It takes 1 unit of work to get something for
  yourself. It takes 3x1 units of work to make it so your office
  neighbor can use it. It takes 3x3x1 units of work so you can use it
  "in the department" and in courses. It takes 3x3x3x1 units of work to
  give it to the world for free without support. 
</p>
<p>So if you use Cadabra in your own work,
  please cite the papers "<em>Introducing Cadabra: a symbolic
	 computer algebra system for field-theory problems</em>" and
  "<em>A field-theory motivated approach to symbolic computer
	 algebra</em>" (see <a
								  href="documentation.html">documentation</a> for publication details)
  to keep the bean counters happy.
</p>
<p>Cadabra is available under the conditions of the 
  <a

	 Public License</a> (version 3).
