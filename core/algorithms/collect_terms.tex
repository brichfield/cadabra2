\cdbalgorithm{collect\_terms}{}

\label{loc_collect_terms}
Collect terms in a sum that differ only by their numerical
pre-factor. This is called automatically on all new input, and also by
some algorithms (in which case it will be indicated in the description
of the command), but in general has to be called by hand.

Note that this command only collects terms which are identical, it
does not collect terms which are different but mathematically
equivalent. See~\subscommand{sumsort} for an example.
