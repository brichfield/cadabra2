\cdbalgorithm{rename\_dummies}{}

Rename the dummy indices in an expression. This can be necessary in
order to make various terms in a sum use the same names for the
indices, so that they can be collected.
\begin{screen}{1,2,3,5}
{m,n,p,q,r,s}::Indices(vector).
A_{m n} B_{m n} - A_{p q} B_{p q};
@rename_dummies!(%);
A_{m n} B_{m n} - A_{m n} B_{m n};
@collect_terms!(%);
0;
\end{screen}
Note that the indices need to have been declared as being part of an
index list, using the \subsprop{Indices} property.
