\cdbalgorithm{pintegrate}{}

Perform a partial integration. This requires an expression with an
object carrying a \subsprop{PartialDerivative} property. The command
should have the name of the partial derivative as an argument:
\begin{screen}{1,2}
\partial{#}::PartialDerivative.
\partial_{m}{A} B C D;
@pintegrate!(%){\partial};
(-1) \partial_{m}(B C D) A;
@prodrule!(%):
@distribute!(%);
- \partial_{m}{B} C D A - B \partial_{m}{C} D A - B C \partial_{m}{D} A;
\end{screen}
See the tutorials and the manual for \subscommand{take\_match} and
\subscommand{replace\_match} for examples in which only particular
terms in an expression are selected and partially integrated.
