\cdbalgorithm{maxima}{}

Feed an expression through the Maxima computer algebra system. This
allows you to e.g.~do trigonometric simplification or other `scalar
computer algebra' for which \cdb does not have any built-in support.
\begin{screen}{1,2,4,5}
trigsimp( sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 ):
@maxima(%);
1;
integrate( \sin(x)**2, x ):
@maxima(%);
(1/2 * x - 1/4 * \sin(2 * x));
\end{screen}
Note that reserved names, like the \verb|\sin| above, get converted to
Maxima notation automatically (and they get translated again when
the result is read back into \cdb).

This command is preliminary and not yet fully functional.
