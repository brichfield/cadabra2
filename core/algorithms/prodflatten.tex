\cdbalgorithm{prodflatten}{}

Removes brackets in a product, that is, makes changes of the type
\begin{equation}
a*(b*c) \rightarrow a*b*c\, .
\end{equation}
In terms of code this reads
\begin{screen}{1,2}
a (b c);
@prodflatten!(%);
a b c;
\end{screen}
The above is sometimes required because it is possible to write and
keep nested products with brackets in order to improve readability of
expressions.
